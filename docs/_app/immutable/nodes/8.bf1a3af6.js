		word guessing game. To play, enter a five-letter English word. For example:</p> <div class="example svelte-1x5nq1n"><span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">r</span> <span class="missing svelte-1x5nq1n">i</span> <span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">t</span> <span class="missing svelte-1x5nq1n">z</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">y</span></div> <p class="svelte-1x5nq1n">The <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">y</span> is in the right place. <span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">r</span> and
		<span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">t</span>
		are the right letters, but in the wrong place. The other letters are wrong, and can be discarded.
